Welcom to the Summer Twilight Fest!
For a limited time, the Celestial Pursuit ad its staff will serve all hunters in vivid seasonal outfits.
A special seasonal platter will also be available, packed with fresh ingredients. And they're on the house!
Get the Handler and your Poogie into the spirit of things with special outfits! Check the Notice Board or the official site for the Summer Twilight Fest availability.
The Handler's special outfit is only available during the event. To change outfits, talk to the Housekeeper and select "Change the Handler's Outfit". Your Poogie's outfit can still be changed even after the event ends.
